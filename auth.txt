Step By Step Sharepoint Authentication
--------------------------------------

1. MFA should be disabled for the user 
   - Ask M365 Admin to disable Multifactor Authentication for the User (This is necessary so that user can login using sharepoint online powershell module)
   
   - Install Powershell Module - Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell
   
   - using below commands set DisableCustomAppAuthentication Property for the tenant. 
   - This Setting is necessary to enable Authentication from Console Application.
   
   - Run both commands using Power shell

	Connect-SPOService -Url https://8cr3ml-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential Ashish@8cr3ml.onmicrosoft.com
	Set-spotenant -DisableCustomAppAuthentication $false
